# Mariner's Dashboard

The [NERACOOS Mariner's Dashboard](https://mariners.neracoos.org/)
is the next generation of our buoy map, redesigned to work natively
with [ERDDAP](http://www.neracoos.org/erddap/index.html) as a
backend data store.

A lightweight service ([Buoy Barn](https://github.com/gulfofmaine/buoy_barn))
provides data about platforms and data to display, latest values,
and enough information that the Mariner's Dashboard is able to
query ERDDAP itself.

## Components and dashboard structure

Mariner's Dashboard is organized around three key functionalities.

- Retrieving and displaying data from ERDDAP.
- User selection of display units.
- Retrieving and displaying the home and about pages.

More specialized components are organized around those categories,
while more general ones are under **Components**.
