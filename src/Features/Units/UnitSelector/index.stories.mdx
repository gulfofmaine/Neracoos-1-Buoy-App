# Unit Selector

[`src/Features/Units/UnitSelector`](https://github.com/gulfofmaine/Neracoos-1-Buoy-App/blob/master/src/Features/Units/UnitSelector/index.tsx) - [Platform M01 - Current Conditions](https://mariners.neracoos.org/platform/M01/)

As part of the Mariner's dashboard we keep track of which unit system a user
would prefer to have the data displayed in.

The unit selector lives at the bottom of the current conditions table
on each platform page, so it's accessable from any tab.
