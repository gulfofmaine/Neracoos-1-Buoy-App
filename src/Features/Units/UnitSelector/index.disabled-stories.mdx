# Unit Selector

[`src/Features/Units/UnitSelector`](https://github.com/gulfofmaine/Neracoos-1-Buoy-App/blob/master/src/Features/Units/UnitSelector/index.tsx) - [Platform M01 - Current Conditions](https://mariners.neracoos.org/platform/M01/)

As part of the Mariner's dashboard we keep track of which unit system a user
would prefer to have the data displayed in.

<Story name="Unit Selector" args={{ system: UnitSystem.english }}>
  {Template.bind()}
</Story>

The unit selector lives at the bottom of the current conditions table
on each platform page, so it's accessable from any tab.

It's usually wrapped up in a Redux `connect()` so it's called as
`<UnitSelector />` instead of more directly as shown.

<ArgsTable story="Unit Selector" />

```tsx
<UnitSelectorBase
    system={UnitSystem.english}
    switchUnits={(system: UnitSystem) => void}
/>
```

export const Template = (args) => <UnitSelectorBase {...args} />
